      I am Smita, I am building my career as a full stack developer. 
      It is all started with my utilizing time during covid-19 lock down. 
      I started learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Angular  and built small projects . 
      Success of these initial small projects motivated me to become a full stack 
      developer. After decent research I got to know a few web concepts I need to 
      learn to become a full stack developer and few ways to learn those. 
      After discussing my research with friends and professional full stack developers 
      I decided to join the boot camp course for full stack developers. 
      Now the hurdle was to decide which boot camp to join. Again discussing a reliable 
      friend and also a full stack developer who did a boot camp course in local Portland
      I decided to have my full stack developer camp from Epicodus. After going through 
      introductory videos of the Epicodus I liked the way pair people learning happens 
      in Epicodus the concepts and whole structure of the which is expected help learn 
      skills fast and robustly. </p>
